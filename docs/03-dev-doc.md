# Developer Documentation

## Meta

This document describes how the system is actually implemented.

It serves two purposes:
1. Document the technical structure of the product
2. Describe how individual features (featXX) are implemented

This document represents the **current implementation (source of truth for reality)**.

---

## How to use this document

### For humans

Use this document to:
- understand how the system works internally
- navigate architecture and components
- onboard new developers
- support debugging and extension

Think:
→ *How is this system built and how does it actually work?*

---

### For AI

When working with this document:

- treat it as the **source of truth for implementation**
- do not invent behavior not implemented
- do not describe intended behavior → use `01-features.md` for that
- ensure consistency with:
  - `01-features.md` (intended behavior)
  - `02-user-doc.md` (user-facing behavior)
- if mismatch is detected → flag inconsistency

---

## What belongs here

Include:
- architecture
- components and modules
- data flow
- interactions between components
- technical constraints
- known limitations

---

## What does NOT belong here

Do NOT include:
- feature planning or ideas → `01-features.md`
- tasks or work tracking → `04-tasks.md`
- bugs or test logs → `05-quality.md`
- user explanations → `02-user-doc.md`

# 🧭 System Overview

## Architecture Overview

- **Plugin Type:** Moodle admin tool (`tool_eledia_mailtemplates`)
- **Integration:** Hooks/Events-based override of selected Moodle notifications
- **Storage:** XMLDB tables for templates, branding, and context assignments
- **Rendering:** Mustache templates with variable resolution

---

## Core Components

*(to be documented during implementation)*

---

## Data Flow

*(to be documented during implementation)*

---

## External Dependencies

- Moodle core messaging API
- Moodle context system
- Moodle events/hooks system

---

## Technical Constraints

- Must not intercept all outgoing emails
- Must remain compatible with Moodle core upgrades
- Only predefined notification types are supported

---

# 🧩 Feature Implementation

Each feature describes how it is implemented in the system.

All entries must:
- reference a feature (featXX)
- describe actual implementation
- avoid speculation

---

# 📏 Rules

- Always describe the current implementation (not the intended one)
- Keep descriptions precise and technical
- Do not duplicate feature descriptions
- Update this document when implementation changes

---

# 🔑 Key Principle

> This document explains how the system is built — not how it should behave.
